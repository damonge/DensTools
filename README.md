# DensTools

Denstools is a code to compute density grids from N-body simulation
outputs and do a bunch of related operations such as:
 - Compute the velocity field
 - Smooth out the density field
 - Compute the tidal tensor
 - Compute the linearized velocity field

Compile by modifying the first lines in Makefile, then "make clean"
and "make".

Running "./DensTools -h" will show all the possible options.
